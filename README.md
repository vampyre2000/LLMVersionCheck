# LLMVersionCheck

Large language models a all the rage at the moment and its hard to keep track of all the updates.
I wrote this simple python script to keep track of the multiple LLM front and backends that focus on running locally
It's a work in progress that displays some of the Backend and front end tools that focus on running Large Language models on local hardware.
So far it keeps track of the following projects
LMStudio 
Koboldcpp
KoboldcppROCM
Ollama_url
GPT4All_url
SillyTavern
SillyTavern

It also displays as a bit of fun, the number of days to the technological singularity.
