# LLM Version Check

Large language models are all the rage at the moment and its hard to keep track of all the updates.
I was busy checking for updates each day and having to check the software versions each day was a pain.
So I thought why not automate it.

I wrote this simple python script to keep track of the multiple LLM front and backends that focus on running locally
It's a work in progress that displays some of the Backend and front end tools that focus on running Large Language models on local hardware.
So far it keeps track of the following projects.
- LMStudio 
- Koboldcpp
- KoboldcppROCM
- Ollama_url
- GPT4All_url
- SillyTavern
- SillyTavern

It also displays as a bit of fun, the number of days to the technological singularity.
